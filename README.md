A fullscreen, scrolling honeycomb-style image collage hooked up with the Instagram API

### Feature Roadmap:

- Generalize for ease of use with any collection of images

- Minor style tweaks:
  - Font size dependant on window size
  - Usernames not showing over videos

- Optimizations:
  - Auto-scroll without using SetInterval
  - Remove unseen hexagons from DOM after dissappearing from page
  - Hexagon videos play only when visible on screen and pause when off

- More options:
  - Vertical scroll
  - Allow small messages or text in top and bottom rows in addition to hashtags
